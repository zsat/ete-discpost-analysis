# An Analysis of ETE Discussion Posts

ETE is my 2-year university program where we routinely discuss problems and solutions around climate change, as well as the social and environmental impacts that climate change has had on the world at large. A way to keep us thinking about issues is through weekly discussion posts, in which we're presented a new or recurring topic (like regenerative agriculture, nuclear energy, sustainable cities, biomimicry, and more) accompanied with a few articles containing stories, facts, or opinions around those topics, and are asked to give our thoughts. This notebook/repo analyzes changes in word count and lexical richness + readability through the first 3 semesters.
