# An Analysis of ETE Discussion Posts

ETE is my 2-year university program where we routinely discuss problems and solutions around climate change, as well as the social and environmental impacts that climate change has had on the world at large. A way to keep us thinking about issues is through weekly discussion posts, in which we're presented a new or recurring topic (like regenerative agriculture, nuclear energy, sustainable cities, biomimicry, and more) accompanied with a few articles containing stories, facts, or opinions around those topics, and are asked to give our thoughts. This notebook/repo analyzes changes in word count and lexical richness + readability through the first 3 semesters.

## Findings
- We're writing (on avg.) 20% more each semester. Mean words jumped by 100 from ~240 to ~340 across 3 semesters. Median words jumped by ~80 in the same span
- Our vocabulary gets better each semester (lexical richness, measured by MTLD) 
- Our sentence/word length (lexical readability) stays relatively the same - perhaps a good thing
- (In my opinion) it seems like we're writing with more/better vocab, but not making our sentences overly complex, rather we're keeping them accessible to the average reader (which in my opinion is the best scenario).

- **Mean + Median word counts per semester** - definitely increasing

- **Word Count Distributions Per Semester** - we see more variance
